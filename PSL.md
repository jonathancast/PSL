# Profitable Software General Public License

This is the Profitable Software General Public License, Version 0.1.
(But please call it the PSL for short, to avoid confusion with the GNU General Public License).
This is a general license - because it can be applied by contributors to any software they own some exclusive rights in -
and a public license - because, once applied it automatically grants rights to everyone in the world.

## Grant of rights

Specifically, once applied by a contributor to a piece of software,
it grants you (regardless of who you are) the right to
 * use,
 * make copies of,
 * bypass any technological measures which control access to,
 * modify,
 * incorporate as a whole into other software,
 * distribute, and
 * use the name of the software, or parts of it, to advertise copies you distribute,
the software, in source or binary form, with or without modifications, provided you comply with the terms of this license,
even if doing so would otherwise violate the patent, copyright, trade secret, or trade mark rights of the contributors under the laws of your country.

Furthermore, if the software constitutes a technological measure which controls access to any other content,
you may bypass that measure,
even if doing so would otherwise violate the rights of the contributors under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws.

The laws of your country may provide ways you can do the above with the software that do not violate the exclusive rights of the contributors.
If so, you may do so regardless of whether you comply with this license,
even if you also engage in activities that would violate those rights without this license.
However, anything you do with the software that would violate the exclusive rights of the contributors under the laws of your country
must be authorized by this license, or by another license from every contributor whose rights are involved.

## Definitions

1. The "source form" of software is the preferred form for modifying it,
   along with version control metadata that is used to record authorship of the software,
   record the revision history of the software,
   and merge changes made to the software by multiple contributors.
2. A "binary form" of software is any other form.
3. The "corresponding" source form to a binary form of the software is one that can be used to reproduce the binary form,
   using only the included files and software in the source form and tools generally available to people who prepare binary forms of software.

## Conditions

1. If you make a copy of the software for your own use, or give a copy to anyone else for their use,
   you must pay the contributors the amount of royalties specified in the copy you are distributing,
   divided among the contributors proportionally to the number of lines of code they contributed
   according to the version control information in the copy you are distributing.
2. Any source or binary form of the software you give to someone else must include a copy of this license in a prominent place.
3. If you transfer ownership of a computing device to someone else,
   and you include a copy of the software, in source or binary form, on the device, as part of the transfer,
   and the copy of the software on the device is in a form that can be modified, by you or anyone else,
   you must include with the transfer all necessary technical documentation for the recipient to replace that copy with a modified version.
   If any encryption keys or passwords or similar information is required to modify the copy on the device,
   or to ensure the continued function of the device and the copy of the software the device,
   you must provide the recipient with either those keys or
   valid information on how to substitute the recipient's own keys for those installed on the device.
4. If the software can be accessed over a computer network,
   and it advertises, to anyone who is authorized to access it,
   where the corresponding source form can be accessed over the public Internet,
   you may not remove that functionality,
   unless you also remove the ability for the software to be accessed over the network entirely.
5. If the software can be accessed over a network and you modify it,
   or if you modify the software so that can be accessed over a network,
   you must also make the corresponding source code available over the public Internet
   to anyone authorized to access any copy of your version of the software,
   and modify the software to indicate instead where your corresponding source code can be obtained.
6. If you give a binary form of the software to someone else,
   you must also give them the corresponding source form,
   at the same time and in the same manner.
   For example, you could give them both on the same medium,
   or as part of the same archive file or download.
   You cannot offer them as parallel downloads, or in any way make receipt of the source form optional, however.
7. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must update the version control metadata in the source form to indicate your authorship of any changed lines.
8. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must license the entire modified version, to everyone, under this license.
   (But you do not have to give anyone but the recipient a copy of your modified version).
9. If you modify the software and give someone else a copy of that modified version,
   you must update the list of contributors in the software to include your name,
   and to indicate where your royalties should be paid to
   (even if your modifications are not enough that you would normally receive royalties for them).
   You must also update all copyright statements on the software to include your name,
   or to say "Copyright Â© Contributors" or similar.
10. You may not update the version control metadata in the source form
   to indicate your authorship of any lines that were previously attributed to anyone else,
   without their consent,
   unless the changes you made were integral to a change to the functionality of the software,
   and were either necessary to make the change or necessary to maintain the previous indentation style of the software.
11. You may not remove anyone's name from the contributors list.
12. You may not change the indication of where royalties owed to a contributor should be sent without their consent.
13. You may not reduce the royalty amounts specified in the software,
   so that anyone would owe fewer royalties than they would under the copy you received.
   You may increase the royalty amount someone would owe for the software,
   although the new royalty amount only applies to copies including your changes.
14. You may not increase the royalty amount in any case above $30/copy.

## Updates

If you give an updated copy of the software to someone who already has an older copy:
  1. If they receive the update within 2 years of getting their previous copy, the royalties owed are pro-rated according to the number of months / 24 since the previous copy.
  2. The royalties should be divided between the contributors who wrote only the lines of the software
     which were modified between the older copy and the newer one,
     proportional to the number of modified lines they contributed.
  3. If you continuously distribute updated copies of the software to someone over the course of a month,
     you may pay one consolidated royalty payment to the contributors of all the modified lines at the end of the month.

The same rules apply if you download updates 

## Exceptions

1. If you give a copy of the software to someone else,
   you or they must pay royalties (unless you have the right to do so under the laws of your country or another license),
   but in no case do both of you need to pay royalties for the same copy.
2. If the royalty requirements listed in the software would require you to pay more than $30 in royalties for a single piece of software,
   you may reduce the royalty amount to $30.
3. Similarly, if the royalty requirements in the software would require you to pay more than $2.50/month for updates to the software, you may reduce the royalty amount to $2.50/month.
4. If you owe less than $15 in total royalties for updates to the software,
   you may wait until the total amount owed exceeds $15 or
   12 months have passed without a royalty payment
   to make the payment.
   In this case, if you round your individual royalty payments,
   you must add up the total payment for the whole period,
   then round.
5. You may round to a multiple of $1 the royalties you owe to any single recipient (not contributor),
   provided the total amount of royalties you pay is still what is required.
   A "recipient" is someone you actually pay royalties to.
   So, if there are three contributors:
     * jack@foo.com
     * jill@foo.com
     * fuzzy@foo.com
   and all three indicate in the list of contributors that royalties should be paid to Foo Corp, 123456 5th Ave New York, NY,
   Foo Corp is a single recipient, not three, and royalties paid to it must be summed up, then rounded.
   However, in particular, you may round to $0 the royalties owed to any recipient who otherwise would be owed less than $1.
6. If for whatever reason you cannot make a royalty payment as indicated in the contributors list,
   and you make a good-faith effort to contact the contributor(s) involved and arrange alternate payment,
   and cannot do so,
   you do not need to pay royalties to the recipients involved.
7. You do not need to pay royalties for:
   * Making a copy of the software to give it to someone else (until you actually do give it to them).
   * Giving a copy of the software to someone else who is only going to use it for further distribution.
   * Any copy which will be used only to evaluate the software, to decide whether to use it.
   * Any copy which will be used only to test the software, to determine if it works correctly.
   * Any copy which will be used only for security analysis of the software.
8. You do not need to include corresponding source with any binary form you give some
   for testing the software or doing security analysis of the software,
   unless the recipient requests it.
9. You do not need to pay royalties on updates to the software provided
   all the updates are changes which the contributors are obligated to make to the software under warranty.
10. You may incorporate a portion of the software into other pieces of software, provided
   * you license the new software, to everyone, under this license,
   * you arrange for the version control metadata on the new software to indicate the same authors for any copied lines as the original software, and
   * you include in the contributors list in the new software all the authors of any copied lines, along with the same instructions for paying royalties as in the original software.
11. You may, alternatively, incorporate a portion of the software into other pieces of software, provided
   * the incorporated portion does not implement, on its own, any entire feature or user-visible behavior of the software, and
   * you license the new software under this license, the GNU General Public License version 3 or later, or the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 or later.
   

## Termination

If you host host any technical forum for general discussion of development of the software,
open to every or most contributors to the software,
and you permanently exclude any contributor from participation in that forum,
you immediately and permanently lose all rights under this license
to distribute copies of the software incorporating lines written by that contributor before the breach,
or copies incorporating changes made by that contributor after the breach,
until that contributor gives you a new license to do so.

If you violate the terms of this license in any other way,
and any contributor informs you of the violation,
you have 30 days to correct the violation.
For example, if you give someone a binary form of the software,
without corresponding source, were obligated to so,
and a contributor informs you of the breach,
you have 30 days to give the recipient the source form.
Similarly, if you give someone a copy of the software,
neglect to pay royalties are obligated to pay,
and a contributor informs you of the breach,
you have 30 days to pay all unpaid royalties.

If you fail to heal any breach of this license within 30 days,
you permanently lose all rights to the software under this license
until all contributors affected by your infringing action give you a new license.

Other than as provided in this section,
your rights under this license are perpetual
and may not be revoked by any contributor at any time for any reason.

## Warranty

The software is warrantied by the contributors to be free of programming defects
that would cause the software to not function as intended by the contributors,
on computer systems similar to those on which it is intended to be used, or
would cause the software to be insecure when used as intended.
If you are dissatisfied with the functionality of the software,
you may inform all contributors to whom you have paid royalties,
destroy all your copies of the software,
and receive a refund of all royalties paid within 2 years prior to your notice.

Should you discover any programming defect
which would cause the software not to function as intended by the contributors, or
which causes a security problem when the software is used as intended,
you may notify the contributor whose programming was defective,
and you will receive from the contributor, at no charge,
whatever changes to the software are necessary to repair the defect.

This warranty is good for a period of 10 years only
after any portion of the software was first distributed by a contributor to another person.

This section constitutes, to the extent allowed by applicable law, the entire warranty on the software;
if any portion of this section is held to be unenforceable,
the software shall have no warranty to the extent allowed under law.

## Non-severability

If any portion of this license is held to be unenforceable, the whole license shall be invalid,
and no one shall receive any rights under this software.

## Applying to your code

To apply this license to your program,
store the source code of you program under a suitable version control system;
include a copy of this license in it, in a separate file;
include a list of contributors, in a separate file, with your name as stored in the version control system;
and instructions on how to pay royalties to you
(e.g., you can give a Paypal URL such as paypal.me/foo, a Bitcoin public key, or a physical address);
and include a prominent notice somewhere in your program (such as in a COPYRIGHT file):

    Copyright Â© <your name> <the year(s) you distribute copies of the software in>
    This software is free as in freedom, not in price;
    you may modify or redistribute it, if you pay a small royalty amount, under the terms of the Profitable Software License,
    included in the file PSL, 

(Change the file name if necessary).
Either list the royalty amount you want there or in a separate 'royalties' file.

If you wrote the program as part of your job,
talk to your employer about the proper copyright notice to use,
and where royalties for your contributions should be sent.

If you wrote the program as part of your job,
and you continue modifying it after you leave,
be sure you use different email addresses for modifications you make before and after you leave,
so you can direct the royalties to different places if you need to.

If you are employed as a programmer,
but you wrote the program outside of work,
you may want to get a written statement from your employer
that the program is not work for hire for them
and you do own the copyright on it.
